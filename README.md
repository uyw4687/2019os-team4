## Project 3

You should provide a complete set of results that show all your tests. If there are any results that do not yield execution time proportional to weights, explain why. Your results and any explanations should be put in the README.md file in the project branch of your team's repository. Your plot should be named plot.pdf and should be put next to the README.md file.
